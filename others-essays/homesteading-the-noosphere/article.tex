\begin{abstract}
  After observing a contradiction between the official ideology defined by
  open-source licenses and the actual behavior of hackers, I examine the actual
  customs that regulate the ownership and control of open-source software.  I
  show that they imply an underlying theory of property rights homologous to the
  Lockean theory of land tenure.  I then relate that to an analysis of the
  hacker culture as a `gift culture' in which participants compete for prestige
  by giving time, energy, and creativity away.  Finally, I examine the
  consequences of this analysis for conflict resolution in the culture, and
  develop some prescriptive implications.
