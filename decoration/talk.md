# Decoration -- Decorators and context managers in Python


We will talk about two advanced but simple features of Python that make coding
more fun (and more safe and more sane and everything).


## Decorators

What is a decorator?  How do we make one?

Perhaps you've seen one of the following:

```python
@skipIf(...)
def test_fun(self):
    pass

@metaclass
class MyClass(object):

    @property
    def msg(self):
        return self._msg

    @classmethod
    def create(cls):
        return MyClass(cls)

    @staticmethod
    def true():
        return MyClass(True)
```


### Decorators in Everest

In Everest we had a couple of validator functions:

```python
def is_valid_realization(r):
    return r > 0

def is_f77(s):
    return len(s) <= 8
```

We wanted a validator function to be able to output a _reason_ why it is False,
but at the same time, a validator should return True or False?

How to come around it so it is cute and nice to use, and hard to use wrong?

Enter decorators.

Suppose the following was possible:

```python

val = is_f77('SOMESTRING')
if not val:
    print('Validation error: %s' % val.msg)  # but False does not have a .msg?
```

We implemented a decorator that you could use like this:



```python

@validation('asserting that r > 0')
def is_valid_realization(r):
    return r > 0

@validation('asserting that s has length at most 8')
def is_f77(s):
    return len(s) <= 8
```

Now, if we run

```python

val = is_f77('SOMESTRING')
if not val:
    print('Validation error: %s' % val.msg)  # but False does not have a .msg?
```

this outputs `Validation error: asserting that s has length at most 8 for s=SOMESTRING`.


### Decorator implementation

So how do we implement a decorator?

First we made a class that wraps a bool, and contains a msg:

```python
class Validation(object):
    def __init__(self, value, msg=''):
        self.value = value
        self.msg = msg

    def __nonzero__(self):
        return self.value

    def __bool__(self):
        return self.value

    @classmethod
    def true(cls):
        return Validation(True)

    @classmethod
    def false(cls, msg=''):
        return Validation(False, msg=msg)
```

The `__bool__` and `__nonzero__` are just so we can evalute them to
truthy/falsy.

So now, if `is_f77` returns `True`, we would rather output `Validation.true()`,
and if it returns `False`, we instead output `Validation.false(msg='some error
message')`.


### The decorator!

```python
def validator(msg):
    def real_decorator(function):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            res = function(*args, **kwargs)
            if res is True:
                return Validation.true()
            return Validation.false(msg='FAIL ' + msg + ' for x=' + str(*args))
        return wrapper
    return real_decorator
```






## Context managers

Have you ever written a line of code, an action, where you thought _"Oh, I must
remember to revert the action later"_?  The famous action/counter-action pattern
is hard to work with, tedious, and error prone.

Examples are
1. `f = open(fname)`
2. `conn = db.open_connection()`
3. `lock.acquire()`
4. `os.chdir(new_path)`
5. `grid.enable_active_indexing_mode()`

These all have counter-actions
1. `f.close()`
2. `conn.close()`
3. `lock.release()`
4. `os.chdir(old_dir)` (you stored `old_dir`, right?)
5. `grid.disable_active_indexing_mode()` (or was it already enabled before the
   _action_?)

These are examples that are _hard to use correctly_ and _easy to use
incorrectly_.  If the API developer forces you to work this way, they are not
doing their job.

If we forget to
1. close the file, we risk running out of OS file descriptors and die
2. close the DB connection, we overload the server, may not correctly flush
   queries
3. release the lock, we might end up in a deadlock state
4. revert the current working directory, this may crash
5. revert back the state of the object we got, caller may be very surprised,
   even mad

A _context manager_ is a construct that allows you to forget about the second
part.



```python
with open('fname', 'r') as f:
    f.write('Hello, world\n')

    f   # f is open
f       # f is closed
```

How does this work?

We will use an example from jokva; `with pushd`.

`pushd` (and `popd`) is a Linux command that changes your directory (works like
`cd`), but remembers where you came from.

You can run `popd` to return to the previous directory.

When `pushd` is called, the directory is pushed onto a stack (`dirs`) and when
`popd` is called, it is popped off the stack.

We want to have this functionality:

```python
with pushd('~/some/path'):
    print(os.cwd())  # returns ~/some/path
    do_stuff()
    call_functions()
os.cwd()  # here we are back to the old cwd
```

### Classical context manager

The with statement is achieved through the use of a context manager.

A context manager in Python is simply anything that has the `__enter__` and
`__exit__` functions.

Whenever we go into the context manager (open file or db, acquire lock, change
dir or whatever), the `__enter__` function is called.

Whenever the `with` scope ends, the `__exit__` function is called.

Now all the API developer has to do is to implement these two functions, and it
will become _much_ simpler to use correctly, and _much_ harder to use
incorrectly.


### Context managers via decorators

Bonus point, because Python is awesome.  Simple context managers can use
decorators!

Python has a decorator called `contextlib.contextmanager` that we can use to
very easily construct context managers.

All you need to do is to make a function _containing one `yield` statement_, and
decorate it with `contextlib.contextmanager`.


```python
# taken from Komodo by jokva

@contextlib.contextmanager
def pushd(path):
    prev = os.getcwd()

    if path is not None:
        os.chdir(path)

    yield
    os.chdir(prev)
```


If we would implement an `active_indexing_mode` in `EclGrid`, we could simply
write:

```python

@contextlib.contextmanager
def ai(self):
    """Temporarily enable active indexing mode."""
    old_mode = self.active_indexing_mode
    self.active_indexing_mode = True

    yield

    self.active_indexing_mode = old_mode
```


Finally, we added, in Everest, a temp area working dir in < 15 lines:


```python
@contextlib.contextmanager
def tmp(path=None, teardown=True):
    """Create and go into tmp directory, returns the path.

    This function creates a temporary directory and enters that directory.  The
    returned object is the path to the created directory.

    If @path is not specified, we create an empty directory, otherwise, it must
    be a path to an existing directory.  In that case, the directory will be
    copied into the temporary directory.

    If @teardown is True (defaults to True), the directory is (attempted)
    deleted after context, otherwise it is kept as is.

    """
    cwd = os.getcwd()
    fname = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile().name

    if path:
        if not os.path.isdir(path):
            raise IOError('No such directory: %s' % path)
        shutil.copytree(path, fname)
    else:
        # no path to copy, create empty dir
        os.mkdir(fname)

    os.chdir(fname)

    yield fname  # give control to caller scope

    os.chdir(cwd)

    if teardown:
        shutil.rmtree(fname)

```

With this, you can copy and goto a completely new directory in `tmp` with

```python

with tmp('test_data/my_case'):
    do_tests()

```


```python

with tmp('test_data/my_case', teardown=False) as pth:
    print('work area=%s' % pth)
    do_tests()
```


Then, of course, you can make a decorator
```python
def tmpdir(path):
    def real_decorator(function):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            with tmp(path):
                return function(*args, **kwargs)

        return wrapper

    return real_decorator
```

so you can use it like this to make a function run with a given `cwd`:


```python

@tmpdir('tests/test_data/case1')
def test_run_case1(self):
    self.assertEqual(fname, x)

```
