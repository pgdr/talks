Blockchain is a solution looking for a problem

+++

besides Bitcoin

* no real use cases yet

---

About property and ownership

* what does it mean to own something?
* philosophical question

+++

practically;

* if you steal something, the police might want to have a say


+++

suppose that Alice owns something (a bike?) and Bob steals the bike.

* Besides philosophical issues,
* the police and the court system

Alice presses charges.  Bob returns the bike.

+++

Suppose now that the property is "defined" in a blockchain

* Bob
  * threatens Alice to give ownership to him
  * steals Alice's login credentials
  * hacks Alice's computer
  * "buys" the bike, but refuses in the end to give money
* Alice
  * gives the bike to Bob (under influence)
  * ... or didn't sell "by reason of insanity"
  * ...

+++

Alice presses charges and the court decides the property is Alice's.

The government does not acknowledge the blockchain.

---

Conclusion:

* To be effective
* any blockchain _needs the acknowledgement_
* from the relevant governments

or

* it cannot define ownership
