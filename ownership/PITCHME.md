About property and ownership

* what does it mean to own something?
* philosophical question

+++

practically;

* if you steal something, the police might want to have a say


---

Suppose that Alice owns a bike and Bob steals it.

Alice presses charges.  Bob returns the bike.

+++


Suppose we place ownership of a physical good

e.g. a bike

on a blockchain

+++

Suppose now that the property is "defined" in a blockchain

* Bob
  * threatens Alice to give ownership to him
  * steals Alice's login credentials
  * hacks Alice's computer
  * "buys" the bike, but refuses in the end to give money
* Alice
  * gives the bike to Bob (under influence)
  * ... or didn't sell "by reason of insanity"
  * ...

+++

Alice presses charges and the court decides the property is Alice's.

The government does not acknowledge the blockchain.

There is a discrepancy between the _"truth"_ and the blockchain;

the blockchain is no longer the truth.

---

Conclusion:

* To be effective
* any blockchain _needs the acknowledgement_
* from the relevant governments.

or

* it cannot define ownership
