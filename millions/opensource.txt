Open source software in Equinor

Governing documents TR1621 v7 gives the foundation for open source in
Equinor, stating that

> (2.1.7) All IT solution procurement and software deliveries shall have
> evaluated open source alternatives.

> (2.8.1) All software developed by/for Equinor shall be made opensource,
> unless IP rights prevents this or there are unacceptable risks.

> (2.8.4) All software development shall, if relevant, utilize open source
> technologies, frameworks and tools.

This document is meant to explain some of the rationale behind these
entries in the governing documents, as well as assisting in choosing the
correct license.


A sneak peak at the license selection process:

; Are we writing a library?
: Use LGPL 3
; Do we want to force other people to release back all changes?
: Use GPL 3
; Otherwise
: Use MIT




== Reasons for writing open source software ==


Public visibility encourages good standards.


'''Easy and robust building and testing and a clean repository.'''

When putting your software out you need to also make clear and neutral
instructions that work on any machine, not just your own.  Furthermore,
we cannot have hard coded usernames, passwords, file paths or other
elements that are considered bad practice in software development.  This
encourages clean and general code.



'''Internal network means hidden assumptions.'''
When you build, test and deploy your code on your internal network you
have access to thousands of sweet libraries.  However!  These sweet
libraries come with a hidden cost, because they are hidden assumptions.
It makes your software tightly (and invisibly so) coupled to your
internal infrastructure. This makes it harder to change your
infrastructure, and harder to change your software.



'''Why would we give away our precious software for free?'''
A common misconseption is that free software is free to use.  Especially
software that is designed to solve one company's or customer's need.
Anyone who wants to use the software themselves need to make changes and
bugfixes.  These means that they (most likely) want to contribute back
with new features, new generalizations, new improvements, etc.



'''Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.'''
The more people that test the software, the more robust it gets.  Nearly
all software today should be cross platform.  We do not have access, nor
time, to test our software on all architectures, platforms, operating
systems, in all environments in Equinor.  However, when people try to
build our system with a new and unknown compiler, for a new and untested
architecture, we get valuable feedback if that doesn't work.



'''Great advertising.'''
When you develop free software you can give a "10 Reasons Why My Company
Develops Free Software" on Booster.  When recruting developers, you get
to point them to code and review practices on github or lauchpad or
wherever you have your code.  If you develop software that students
might use, they can download it and test it even before they start
working in your company.



'''Develop reference implementations for file formats.'''
The software package, or library, segyio, today serves as a first
reference implementation for the SEG-Y file format developed in the 70s.
Any file format without a reference implementation risks being
under-defined and thus several incompatible formats will appear.  This
hurts, not only Equinor, but the entire industry.



'''Open company increases public trust.'''
Being open is one of Equinor's core values.  Putting our source code
online for everyone to see, puts our money where our mouth's at.


'''Contributing to the open source community.'''
All the world, and Equinor is no exception, is today dependent on open
source software.  We use it, very often for free, and one can argue that
we have a moral responsibility of contributing back.  There are several
cases where we have contributed back to software we use, but we are far
from a major player in the open source community.  We have a way to go.



''' Open source is like science.'''



== Choosing a license ==

There are several licenses to choose from, and that can be confusing,
however, there aren't that many licenses relevant for Equinor.

Here is a long list of licenses:

* GNU GPL 2 v 3
* GNU AGPL
* GNU LGPL
* MIT
* APACHE
* BSD

Open licenses for non-code projects:

* CREATIVE COMMONS
* ODbL



Out of them, we highly recommend the subset

* GNU GPL 3
* GNU LGPL
* MIT

=== How to choose ===

The choice should be as follows:

: Are we writing a library?
; Use LGPL 3
: Do we want to force other people to release back all changes?
; Use GPL 3
: Otherwise
; Use MIT



=== Examples of open source licenses is the real world ===

Here are some examples:

* GNU GPL 2 (Linux, MediaWiki, Wordpress, +++, ERT, OPM)
* GNU GPL 3 (GCC, GNU, +++, Sunbeam)
* GNU AGPL (Launchpad)
* GNU LGPL (QT, Vorbis*, Segyio)
* MIT (Jenkins, Atom, Compiz, Mono, Ncurses, Node.js)
* APACHE (Android, Apache, Kubernetes, PyCharm)
* BSD (Chromium, D3, Django, Flask, Nginx, Vorbis)

For the content licenses,

* CREATIVE COMMONS (Wikipedia content, pictures, music)
* Open Database Licence (Norne)


=== How to maintain an open source project ===

There are many resources for maintaining an open source project, among
them is a guide from Digial Ocean:
