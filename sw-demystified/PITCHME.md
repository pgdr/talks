### Software development

* is extremely complex
* is the formalization of ideas
* needs to be 100% correct or else it crashes
 * or even worse, it doesn't


+++
### Software development

* is extremely complex

 ... but billions of CPUs run millions of instructions per second


+++
### Software development

Everything today is accommodated by an instruction written by a developer

#### digitalization = IT


+++
### Software development


* Why does it work?


+++
### Software development

professionalism.

+++
### Software development

* education
* experience
* methods, best practices
* ———

### Software development

The waterfall model

1. Requirements
2. Design
3. Implementation
4. Validation
5. Maintenance

#### Technology

* GUI (Graphical User Interfaces)
 * Human interaction.
 * Mouse and keyboards.
 * Users and screens.
* API (Application Programming Interface)
 * Programs communicating with each other.
 * Necessary in automation and machine learning.
 * ML = programming + data + statistics


+++
#### Summary

* Software engineering is a complex field
 * need an education, need experience
* Software projects **are different**
* Agile is not for fun
* Cloud and API are the future
