+++
### Power (Turing)

* Game of Life
* `Y=λf.(λx.f(xx))(λx.f(xx))`
* programming languages
 * C++
 * Python
 * ...

Can run _any_ program, simulation, computation.

They can simulate (as far as we know) a human brain!


+++
### Software development

* is extremely complex
* is the formalization of ideas
* needs to be 100% correct or else it crashes
 * or even worse, it doesn't


+++
### Software development

* is extremely complex

 ... but billions of CPUs run millions of instructions per second


+++
### Software development

there is not a single thing today not involving an instruction written by a
developer

#### digitalization = it


+++
### Software development

 ... but we have methods, best practices and experience

_(backed by empirical evidence)_


+++
### Software development

* Why does it work?
 * it's a profession


+++
### Software development

* we have
 * education
 * experience
 * methods, best practices
* we also have
 * responsibility
 * trust


+++
### Software development

> Access to developers is a bigger threat to business success than access to
> capital.

In fact,

> People are not your most important asset. The right people are.


+++
### Software development

The waterfall model

* Requirements
* Design
* Implementation
* Validation
* Maintenance

+++
### Software development

The waterfall model is broken

* don't know the requirements, don't understand the problem
* not aware of future difficulties
* delays testing until after completion

### Software development

Agile is, from day 1:

* individuals and interactions
* working software
* customer collaboration
* responding to change

## PART II


+++
#### Technology

* Question: What is the cloud?

+++

![There is no cloud](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/sw-demystified/assets/no-cloud.png)

+++
#### Technology

* Question: Why cloud?
 * scalability
 * pay-per-use
 * enables information sharing
 * fascilitates cooperation, internally and externally

+++
#### Technology

* Question: What is the cloud for Equinor

OMNIA is our MS Azure configuration

* OMNIA data
* OMNIA apps
* OMNIA aurora
* OMNIA radix

with access control
* legal
* information owners ...

+++
#### Technology

* Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Software as a Service (SaaS)


+++
#### Technology

* GUIs (human interaction)
 * Graphical User Interfaces
 * (mouse and keyboards)
 * (users and screens)
* APIs
 * Application Programming Interface
 * how programs communicate with eachother
 * necessary in automation


+++
#### Technology

* APIs
 * _API first strategy_
 * _AI ready_
  * aka machine learning

+++
##### Machine Learning

Example: Recall

+++
##### Machine Learning

Machine learning is:

* software engineering +
* statistics

* Accuracy
* 99% accurate is good (or ... ?)
* data leakage


+++
#### Summary

* Cloud is someone else's computer
* Cloud is treated as a "meta-computer"
* GUIs are not the future, APIs are
* Machine learning (AI) is software engineering with statistics using APIs

+++
#### Summary

* Software engineering is a complex field
 * need an education, need experience
* Software projects **are different**, not c&c
* Agile is not for fun
 * nor is it lean or anything else you hear
