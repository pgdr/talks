### COPYRIGHT

* No license can take away your copyright
* Everything you make is immediately your copyright (caveat employee)
* Licenses are contracts!

+++

### COPYRIGHT

* If you have copyright
  * you can relicense to whatever
* You cannot give away copyright (in Norway you can?)
  * hence, e.g. FSF and ERT ask you to
  * sign a contract allowing them to relicense your code
* FSF owns all GNU code and could therefore upgrade GPL2 to GPL3
* Linux copyrights scattered around, cannot upgrade (won't anyway)

### GNU General Public License

---

#### GPL 2 states

* copy, modify, and distribute the software
* modifications to software GPL 2
  * must be available under GPL 2
* (with build instructions)

---

##### Tivoization

Suppose that I go ahead and
* make a car running Linux
* only signed software can run on car
* people can get and modify source code
* but not run the modified software on the car

Was it really possible to modify the source code as per GPL 2?

---

##### Tivoization

Richard M. Stallman was annoyed.

Made GNU GPL3

Linus Torvalds says he understands the car manufacturer.

---

#### GPL 3 states

* copy, modify, and distribute the software
* modifications to software GPL 3
  * must be available under GPL 3
* (with build instructions)

+++

GPL3 also contains more
* specific about license compatibility (e.g. apache)
* DRM (tivo)
* explicit patents stuff
  * (cannot deny rights via patents)
* make AGPL explicitly necessary
  * (if software not sent, no distribution necessary)
  * (recall Wordpress)

---

#### AGPL 3 (Affero GPL)

* For network software
* copy, modify, and distribute the software
* derivative work must be redistributed under AGPL
* if the software is used in "web publication"
  * the source code must be made available

---

#### LGPL 3 (Library/Lesser GPL)

* For libraries
* copy, modify, and distribute the software
* derivative work must be redistributed under LGPL
* applications using the library needn't
