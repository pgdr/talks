### COPYRIGHT

* No license can take away your copyright
* Everything you make is immediately your copyright (caveat employee)
* Licenses are contracts!

+++

### COPYRIGHT

* If you have copyright
  * you can relicense to whatever
* You cannot give away copyright (in Norway you can?)
  * hence, e.g. FSF and ERT ask you to
  * sign a contract allowing them to relicense your code
* FSF owns all GNU code and could therefore upgrade GPL2 to GPL3
* Linux copyrights scattered around, cannot upgrade (won't anyway)

### GNU General Public License

#### GPL 2 states

---

##### Tivoization

Suppose that I go ahead and
* make a car running Linux
* only signed software can run on car
* people can get and modify source code
* but not run the modified software on the car

Was it really possible to modify the source code as per GPL 2?

##### Tivoization

Richard M. Stallman was annoyed.

Made GNU GPL3

Linus Torvalds says he understands the car manufacturer.
