### COPYRIGHT

* No license can take away your copyright
* Everything you make is immediately your copyright (caveat employee)
* Licenses are contracts!

### COPYRIGHT

* If you have copyright
  * you can relicense to whatever
* You cannot give away copyright (in Norway you can?)
  * hence, e.g. FSF and ERT ask you to
  * sign a contract allowing them to relicense your code
* FSF owns all GNU code and could therefore upgrade GPL2 to GPL3
* Linux copyrights scattered around, cannot upgrade (won't anyway)
