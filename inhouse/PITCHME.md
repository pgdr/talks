### Inhouse Software Development

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

+++

#### Inhouse developers

* Enormous cost
  * wrong people
  * good people might leave
* We don't have the competence
* Nor the traditions of the craft
* Nor the culture



---
#### Leading advisor

@ul
* Purely advisory role (no "power") <br /> ![power](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/nopower.gif)
* We write some governance <br /> ![tr1621](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/tr1621.jpg)

+++
#### Leading advisor

* Purely advisory role (no "power")
* We write some governance, but don't "own" it
* Ask for help without being scared of retribution
* The Chief Engineer has your back!

#### Why pros and cons of SW?

What makes software development different?

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

@ul
* the art of formalizing ideas
* no laws of nature, limitations
  * so very little intuition
  * especially non-developers
* don't solve the same problem twice, hence more like research
* **Turing completeness**® (& Church-Turing thesis)
@ulend

#### Software engineering is unlike anything

> "The cruelty of teaching computer science"

— E. W. Dijkstra

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

completely different project management

@ul
* leaders do not grasp the fundamental difference
* leaders do not understand the complexity
* leaders do not believe developers' estimates
@ulend

#### Software engineering is a special craft

#### Why inhouse development

* as opposed to outsourced development
* not _as opposed to off-the-shelf procurement_

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. **SIB!**
@ulend

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. long-term commitment, deep involvement
1. we can fail fast (as in super-fast)
1. direct access between users, PO, and developers
1. being our own client makes life simpler
1. no language or culture boundaries, timezone
1. have (access to) domain knowledge
1. speed of development (weeks vs years)
1. no off-the-shelf alternatives (e.g. tempest)
1. we may build upon _all_ open source software
1. we build the necessary culture
1. build expertise ...
1. main benefit: knowledge
@ulend


+++
#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations

+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: governance

> management don't trust me, I'll just follow the rules

The hard part is
@ul
* innovation
* going out on a limb
* being vulnerable
* being humble
* trying your best to solve a hard problem
* ... and improving status quo
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: governance

Why do we have governance?

@ul
* The CEO on a hearing after an "incident"
  * Did we follow the governing documents?
  * ... and do we believe that that's enough?
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: no-slack incompetent project lead

@ul
* Limited respect for knowledge workers and the craft.
* Incompetent project leaders.
* Top-heavy project organization.
* _People under time pressure don't think faster._ (Lister's law)
@ulend

+++
#### challenge: strategies

> There is an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

— Pål's law

+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul
* understanding of software
* conception of _correctness_
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices
* grasp about _cost and lifecycle commitment_
* _(note the omission of **governance**)_
@ulend



+++
#### challenge: mindlessly cutting costs,

or: how to throw the baby out with the bathwater
simultaneously losing trust

@snap[fragment]
>Optimization using data and model update resulted in increased production potential
@snapend

@snap[fragment]
>the value of this optimization has been estimated to NOK2bn
@snapend


+++
#### challenge: excellence — in what?

* Frankensteinian teams delivering sub-excellence
* Causes frustration among developers
* Causes confusions among stakeholders

+++
#### challenge: the dark side of the shared culture

@ul
* shared culture has several _pros_
* but it comes with _cons_ as well:
  * our natural culture is a second-class citizen
    * principles
    * programmer's oath
    * open source
    * ...
  * the primary culture is shoehorned to fit programming
    * safety
    * corruption
    * ... other values?
@ulend

#### Programmer's oath

+++
##### Programmer's oath (1)
>I will not produce harmful code.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (2)
>The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (3)
>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (4)
>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (5)
>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (6)
>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (7)
>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (8)
>I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (9)
>I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence (but manage to follow governance)
  * ratio of doers and non-doers: 20/80?
  * little support of _The Craft_
