### Inhouse Software Development

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

#### Inhouse developers

* Enormous cost
* We don't have the competence
* ... nor the traditions of the craft
* ... nor the culture



---
#### Leading advisor

@ul
* Purely advisory role (no "power") <br /> ![power](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/nopower.gif)
* We write some governance <br /> ![tr1621](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/tr1621.jpg)

#### Leading advisor

* Purely advisory role (no "power")
* We write some governance, but don't "own" it
* Ask for help without being scared of retribution
* The Chief Engineer has your back!

#### Why pros and cons of SW?

What makes software development different?

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

@ul
* the art of formalizing ideas
* no laws of nature, limitations
  * so very little intuition
  * especially non-developers
* don't solve the same problem twice, hence more like research
* Church–Turing thesis
@ulend

#### Software engineering is a special craft

#### Why inhouse development

* as opposed to outsourced development
* not _as opposed to off-the-shelf procurement_

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. **Software Innovation!**
@ulend

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. long-term commitment, deep involvement
1. we can fail fast (as in super-fast)
1. direct access between users, PO, and developers
1. being our own client makes life simpler
1. no language or culture boundaries, timezone
1. have (access to) domain knowledge
1. speed of development (weeks vs years)
1. no off-the-shelf alternatives (e.g. tempest)
1. we may build upon _all_ open source software
1. we build the necessary culture
1. build expertise ...
1. main benefit: knowledge

#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations

+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: governance

> management don't trust me, I'll just follow the rules

The hard part is

@ul
* innovation
* going out on a limb and being vulnerable
* trying your best to solve a hard problem
* ... and improving status quo
* **do difficult math stuff**
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: no-slack incompetent project lead

@ul
* Incompetent project leaders.
* Top-heavy project organization.
* Limited respect for knowledge workers and the craft.
* Causes frustration among developers
* Causes confusions among stakeholders
* _People under time pressure don't think faster._ (Lister's law)
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: strategies

> There is an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

@ul
* Strategies made by non-technical leaders lowers trust
* ... which makes it hard to get everyone to pull in _One Direction_
@ulend



+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul
* understanding of software
* conception of _correctness_
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices
* grasp about _cost and lifecycle commitment_
* _(note the omission of **governance**)_
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: the dark side of the shared culture

@ul
* shared culture has several _pros_
* but it comes with _cons_ as well:
  * our natural culture is a second-class citizen
    * principles
    * programmer's oath
    * open source
    * ...
  * the primary culture is shoehorned to fit programming
    * safety
    * corruption
    * ... other values?
@ulend


---
### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence (but manage to follow governance)
  * ratio of doers and non-doers: 20/80?
  * little support of _The Craft_
@ulend

#### Open questions and future work

* What next?
