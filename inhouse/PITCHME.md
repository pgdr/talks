#### Software Craftsmanship Day

+++

**Cartesian doubt**

We must doubt that the way we work is the best

We must try to improve

1. Always ask your colleagues
1. Always ask your customer
1. Always ask your users

how we can be better


+++
**Agile Manifesto**

@ul
1. _Individuals and interactions_ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over processes and tools
1. _Working software_ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over comprehensive documentation
1. _Customer collaboration_ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over contract negotiation
1. _Responding to change_ <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over following a plan

**Software Craftsmanship Manifesto**

@ul
1. Not only working software,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also _well-crafted software_
1. Not only responding to change,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also _steadily adding value_
1. Not only individuals and interactions,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also _a community of professionals_
1. Not only customer collaboration,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but also _productive partnerships_

**Well-Crafted Software**

@ul
* We humbly demonstrate our expertise by delivering quality software. We do not inflate our abilities or claim expertise where we have none.
* We continually master a variety of technologies and techniques. We do not let unfamiliarity dissuade us from using the best tools.
* We take responsibility for the correctness of our code by testing it thoroughly. We do not tolerate preventable defects.
@ulend

+++
**Steadily Adding Value**

@ul
* We estimate with diligence. We do not let fear or pressure make us promise what we can’t deliver.
* We always apply our best efforts to complete our work. We do not make excuses.
* We work at a sustainable pace. We do not burn out.
@ulend

(_8th light principles_)

+++

**A Community of Professionals**

@ul
* We embrace differences of opinion and personality. We do not allow our current practice to impede improvement.
* We prefer open source tools that we can inspect, evaluate, and improve. We avoid proprietary products that lack transparency.
* We teach anyone with a willingness to learn. We do not hoard our knowledge or practices.
@ulend

(_8th light principles_)

+++

**Productive Partnerships**

@ul
* We show respect for our customers and fellow software crafters. We do not act unprofessionally or unethically.
* We communicate our progress honestly and openly with our customers. We do not conceal or embellish.
* We partner with our customers to understand their business. We do not propose solutions until we are sure we have found the right problem.

Why is there a software craftsmanship movement?

#### Inhouse software development


+++

* Enormous cost
* We don't have the competence
* ... nor the traditions of the craft
* ... nor the culture



---
#### Leading advisor

@ul
* Purely advisory role (no "power") <br /> ![power](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/nopower.gif)
* We write some governance <br /> ![tr1621](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/tr1621.jpg)
@ulend


+++
#### Leading advisor

* Purely advisory role (no "power")
* We write some governance, but don't "own" it
* Ask for help without being scared of retribution
* The Chief Engineer has your back!

#### Why pros and cons of SW?

What makes software development different?

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

@ul
* the art of formalizing ideas
* no laws of nature, limitations
  * so very little intuition
  * especially non-developers
* don't solve the same problem twice, hence more like research
* Church–Turing thesis
@ulend


+++
#### Software engineering is a special craft

#### Why inhouse development

* as opposed to outsourced development
* not _as opposed to off-the-shelf procurement_

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. **Software Innovation!**
@ulend

+++
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
1. long-term commitment, deep involvement
1. we can fail fast (as in super-fast)
1. direct access between users, PO, and developers
1. being our own client makes life simpler
1. no language or culture boundaries, timezone
1. have (access to) domain knowledge
1. speed of development (weeks vs years)
1. no off-the-shelf alternatives (e.g. tempest)
1. we may build upon _all_ open source software
1. we build the necessary culture
1. build expertise ...
1. main benefit: knowledge
@ulend


+++
#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations

+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: governance

> management don't trust me, I'll just follow the rules

The hard part is

@ul
* innovation
* going out on a limb and being vulnerable
* trying your best to solve a hard problem
* ... and improving status quo
* **do difficult math stuff**
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: no-slack incompetent project lead

@ul
* Incompetent project leaders.
* Top-heavy project organization.
* Limited respect for knowledge workers and the craft.
* Causes frustration among developers
* Causes confusions among stakeholders
* _People under time pressure don't think faster._ (Lister's law)
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: strategies

> There is an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

@ul
* Strategies made by non-technical leaders lowers trust
* ... which makes it hard to get everyone to pull in _One Direction_
@ulend



+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul
* understanding of software
* conception of _correctness_
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices
* grasp about _cost and lifecycle commitment_
* _(note the omission of **governance**)_
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: the dark side of the shared culture

@ul
* shared culture has several _pros_
* but it comes with _cons_ as well:
  * our natural culture is a second-class citizen
    * principles
    * programmer's oath
    * open source
    * ...
  * the primary culture is shoehorned to fit programming
    * safety
    * corruption
    * ... other values?
@ulend


---
### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence (but manage to follow governance)
  * ratio of doers and non-doers: 20/80?
  * little support of _The Craft_
@ulend

---
#### Open questions and future work

* What next?
