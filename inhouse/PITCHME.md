### Inhouse Software Development

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

+++

#### Inhouse developers

* Enormous cost
  * wrong people
  * good people might leave
* We don't have the competence
* Nor the traditions of the craft
* Nor the culture



---
#### Leading advisor

@ul
* Purely advisory role (no "power") <br /> ![power](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pgdr/talks/master/inhouse/power.gif)
* Ask for help without being scared of retribution
* The professional network (Chief Engineer) will have your back
* We write some governance, but don't control it
@ulend

#### Software engineering is unlike anything

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

@ul
* the art of formalizing ideas
* no laws of nature, limitations
  * so very little intuition
  * especially non-developers
* don't solve the same problem twice, hence more like research
@ulend

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike anything

completely different project management

@ul
* leaders do not understand the complexity
* leaders do not believe developers' estimates
* software projects are more like research projects than trad projects
@ulend


+++
#### Software engineering is a craft

#### Why inhouse development

@ul
* long-term commitment, deep involvement
* direct access to users and developers
* being our own client makes life simpler, fail fast
* no language or culture boundaries
* have (access to) domain knowledge
* speed of development (weeks vs years)
* no off-the-shelf alternatives (e.g. tempest)
* we may build on _all_ open source software
* we build the necessary culture
* build expertise ...
* main benefit: knowledge
@ulend

#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations


+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: governance

> management don't trust me, I'll just follow the rules

The hard part is
@ul
* innovation
* going out on a limb
* being vulnerable
* being humble
* trying your best to solve a hard problem
* ... and improving status quo
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: governance

> acquire trust by giving trust

@css[fragment](**governing** = _controlling the creative & unpredictable_)


+++
#### challenge: no-slack incompetent project lead

@ul
* Limited respect for knowledge workers and the craft.
* Incompetent project leaders.
* Top-heavy project organization.
* _People under time pressure don't think faster._ (Lister's law)
@ulend

+++
#### challenge: strategies

> There is an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

— Pål's law

+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul
* understanding of software
* conception of _correctness_
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices
* grasp about _cost and lifecycle commitment_
* _(note the omission of **governance**)_
@ulend



+++
#### challenge: mindlessly cutting costs,

or: how to throw the baby out with the bathwater
simultaneously losing trust

@snap[fragment]
>Optimization using data and model update resulted in increased production potential
@snapend

@snap[fragment]
>the value of this optimization has been estimated to NOK2bn
@snapend


+++
#### challenge: excellence — in what?

Frankensteinian teams delivering subpar "digital"

+++
#### challenge: the dark side of the shared culture

@ul
* shared culture has several _pros_
* but it comes with _cons_ as well:
  * our natural culture is a second-class citizen
  * the primary culture is shoehorned to fit programming
    * safety
    * corruption
    * ... other values?
@ulend


---
#### Some remedies ...

* Open development
* Community building and sharing
* Competence building, courses, etc..

(note omission of _governance_)

#### Programmer's oath

+++
##### Programmer's oath (1)
>I will not produce harmful code.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (2)
>The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (3)
>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (4)
>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (5)
>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (6)
>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (7)
>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (8)
>I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

+++
### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence (but follow governance)
  * ratio of doers and non-doers is 20/80
  * little backing of the craft
@ulend
