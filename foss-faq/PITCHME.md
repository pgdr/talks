### Free software

> Hvorfor gi noe bort gratis som vi har brukt millioner på å utvikle?!

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_


---
### History (before 1984)

* Software was written and distributed
* Different architectures
* Code was considered _«public domain»_
* 1975—85: Code is copyrightable; proprietary code

+++
### History (1980s)

* Richard Stallman started GNU Project
* —— wrote GNU Manifesto, later
 * Free Software Foundation
 * GNU General Public License (GPL)


+++
### History (1990s)

> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
> professional like gnu)

* Linux (1991)
* Linux lisensiert under GPL (1992)

+++
### History (1990s)

> OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to
> Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the intrinsic
> parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not
> replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a
> long term developer mindshare threat.

— Microsoft, Halloween documents (1998)

+++
### History (1990s)

Microsoft released two attacks on the OSS process

* _"fear, uncertainty and doubt"_ (FUD)
* _"embrace, extend, extinguish"_ (EEE)


+++
### Today

* 500 out of 500 supercomputers
* The majority of Microsoft Azure,
 * Google and Amazon
 * Facebook and Twitter and Instagram
 * LinkedIn and eBay and IBM
* Microsoft IoT
* 80% of the world's phone market runs Android
* Toyota, Audi, Ford, Mazda, Subaru, Mercedes..


---
### Licenses

+++
### Free software

The freedom to

* **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
* **study how the program works**, and change it
* **redistribute copies** so you can help others
* **distribute copies** of your modified versions to others


+++
### Opphavsrett Til Åndsverk

> den som skaper et åndsverk har opphavsrett
>
> unntak: datamaskinprogrammer.  opphavsrett går til arbeidsgiveren

_(«Lov om opphavsrett til åndsverk»)_




+++
### Copyright

* Free software is based on the copyright law
* Everything you create is your copyright _(opphavrett til åndsverk)_
* Licenses are contracts giving more rights



+++
### Free software

Two main classes of licenses:

* share-alike, _"copyleft"_
* anything you like, _"permissive"_



+++
### Examples

* GNU GPL 2 (Linux, MediaWiki, Wordpress, +++)
* GNU GPL 3 (GCC, GNU, +++)
* GNU AGPL (Launchpad)
* GNU LGPL (QT, Vorbis*, Segyio)
* MIT (Jenkins, Atom, Compiz, Mono, Node.js)
* APACHE (Android, Apache, Kubernetes, PyCharm)
* BSD (Chromium, D3, Django, Flask, Nginx, Vorbis)
* Creative Commons (Wikipedia-innhold)
* Open Database Licence (OpenStreetMaps, ...)


+++
### GNU General Public License


+++
#### GPL 2/3 states

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under GPL 2/3
* (it must be possible to actually run it)

(GPL 3 contains some extra snack)


+++
#### AGPL 3 (Affero GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under AGPL
* if the software is served as "web publication"
 * the source must be distributed




+++
#### LGPL 3 (Library/Lesser GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under LGPL
* software using LGPL do not need be


+++
#### BSD, MIT & Apache

* BSD, MIT & Apache
 * Do as you wish
 * Retain license
* Apache
 * Some patent stuff


+++
### Creative commons

(for content)

* by = attribution
* sa = share-alike
* nc = non-commercial (ufri!)
* nd = no-derivates (ufri?)


+++
### Open Database Licence

Like cc-by-sa, but for "data"


---
### Why, Equinor!?


* Three categories
 * company / shareholders
 * project / product
 * team / developers



+++
##### (company) commoditize complementaries

* demand of a product
* inverse of price for complementary products


+++
##### (company) Advertising and recruitment

* can show _«real development»_
* talk about it on conferences, workshops, universities
 * share knowledge
 * competence lift,
 * give something back


+++
##### (company) Openness yields trust

* increased confidence to the IT community (also internally)
* One of Equinor's code values (**åpenhet**)
 * best way IT can be open
* open infrastructure (Kerckhoffs' principle)


+++
##### (project) Redice product development time

* If you are based on proprietary software
 * ignore lots of knowledge and solved problems

> standing on the shoulders of giants



+++
##### (project) increased quality

* Source code: written once / read thousands / run millions
* if you claim to be free
 * README
 * up-to-date description of product
 * instruction manual
 * installation manual
 * automatic tests

+++
##### (project) given enough eyeballs

* in open code (empirical and anecdotal)
 * fewer bugs
 * more tests
* we regularly receive feedback from externals
 * bugs
 * improvements
 * new functionality


+++
##### (team) complete focus on development

* open source software development has
 * GitHub
 * Travis
 * CircleCI
 * AppVeyor
 * Codacy
* and easier access to the code(!)


+++
##### (developer) every patch and review is a ☆

* every
 * patch,
 * commit,
 * review a star in their resume
* we rarely get to show our work


+++
##### (developer) Contribute back

Create a
* pip package
* Debian package
* RedHat package
* npm package

Ubuntu? — you have completed the game!

> `apt install my_pkg`

# FAQ

# Basics of Open Source

+++
## What is "Open Source" software?

Software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.

1. Free Redistribution
2. Source Code
3. Derived Works
4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
7. Distribution of License
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral


+++
## Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?

All Open Source software can be used for commercial purpose; the Open Source Definition guarantees this. You can even sell Open Source software.


+++
## Can I restrict how people use an Open Source licensed program?


No. The freedom to use the program for any purpose is part of the Open Source Definition


+++
## Can I stop "evil people" from using my program?

No. The Open Source Definition specifies that Open Source licenses may not discriminate against persons or groups. Giving everyone freedom means giving evil people freedom, too.


+++
## What is "free software" and is it the same as "open source"?


"Free software" and "open source software" are two terms for the same thing: software released under licenses that guarantee a certain specific set of freedoms.

The term "free software" is older, and is reflected in the name of the Free Software Foundation (FSF)

strategy and rhetoric

free: ideological
open: practical


One of the tactical concerns often cited by adopters of the term "open source" was the ambiguity of the English word "free", which can refer either to freedom or to mere monetary price

+++
## What is "copyleft"? Is it the same as "open source"?

"Copyleft" refers to licenses that allow derivative works but require them to use the same license as the original work.

Most copyleft licenses are Open Source, but not all Open Source licenses are copyleft. When an Open Source license is not copyleft, that means software released under that license can be used as part of programs distributed under other licenses, including proprietary (non-open-source) licenses. For example, the BSD license is a non-copyleft Open Source license. Such licenses are usually called either "non-copyleft" or "permissive" open source licenses


+++
## What is a "permissive" Open Source license?

A "permissive" license is simply a non-copyleft open source license — one that guarantees the freedoms to use, modify, and redistribute, but that permits proprietary derivative works. See the copyleft entry for more information.


+++
## Is <SOME PROGRAM> Open Source?

Only if it uses one of the approved licenses, and releases appropriate software.



+++
## Is <SOME LICENSE> an Open Source license, even if it is not listed on your web site?

In general, no. We run all licenses through an approval process to provide an accepted standard on which licenses are Open Source, and we list the approved ones. Be dubious of claimed Open Source-ness for licenses that haven't gone through the process. See also the license proliferation page for why this matters so much.

+++
## Is a license an Open Source license if it is just a few words different from a license listed on your web site?

Many older licenses, such as the BSD license, have several variations that differ only by a few words or sentences. Unfortunately, it is not possible for OSI to approve every variation, so we cannot say if a specific variation is approved. Where possible, please avoid using these variants, and instead use the same version used on the OSI website.

+++
## What about software in the "public domain"? Is that Open Source?

For most practical purposes, it is — sort of. This is a complicated question, so please read on.



+++
## Distributing and Using Open Source Software

What if I do not want to distribute my program in source code form? Or what if I don't want to distribute it in either source or binary form?

If you don't distribute source code, then what you are distributing cannot meaningfully be called "Open Source". And if you don't distribute at all, then by definition you're not distributing source code, so you're not distributing anything Open Source.

+++
## Which Open Source license should I choose to release my software under?

You can choose any license from the open source licenses listed starting here: opensource.org/licenses.


+++
## Which Open Source license is best?

All of them


+++
## How do I apply <SOME OPEN SOURCE LICENSE> to software I'm releasing?


Many licenses come with instructions on how to apply them


+++
## What are "contributor agreements"? Are they like open source licenses?

Many open source projects will only accept patches (code contributions or documentation contributions) from people who have submitted a legal document known as a contributor agreement.

* Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
* Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA)



+++
## Can I write proprietary code that links to a shared library that's open source?

Sometimes you can; it depends on the Open Source license.


+++
## How do I make money if anybody can sell my code?

You can sell services based on the code (i.e., sell your time), sell warranties and other assurances, sell customization and maintenance work, license the trademark, etc.


+++
## Can I sell Open Source programs? Even if I haven't written it?

Yes, you can. But depending on the license, you probably can't stop your customers from selling it in the same manner as you.


+++
## Does Open Source mean anybody else can use my name and logo?

No, at least not any more than they could otherwise.
