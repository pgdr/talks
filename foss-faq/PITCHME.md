### Free software (open source?)

>_All software developed by or for Equinor shall be made open source unless …_

+++
### Free software

> Hvorfor gi noe bort gratis som vi har brukt millioner på å utvikle?!

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

+++
### Free software

1. What is open source software?
2. Why do we use it?
3. Why do we give away code for free?

---
### History (before 1984)

* Software was written and distributed
* Different architectures
* Code was considered _«public domain»_
* 1975—85: Code is copyrightable; proprietary code

+++
### History (1980s)

* Richard Stallman started GNU Project
* —— wrote GNU Manifesto, later
 * Free Software Foundation
 * GNU General Public License (GPL)


+++
### History (1990s)

> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
> professional like gnu)

* Linux (1991)
* Linux lisensiert under GPL (1992)

+++
### History (1990s)

> OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to
> Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the intrinsic
> parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not
> replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a
> long term developer mindshare threat.

— Microsoft, Halloween documents (1998)

+++
### History (1990s)

Microsoft released two attacks on the OSS process

* _"fear, uncertainty and doubt"_ (FUD)
* _"embrace, extend, extinguish"_ (EEE)


+++
### Today

* 500 out of 500 supercomputers
* The majority of Microsoft Azure,
 * Google and Amazon
 * Facebook and Twitter and Instagram
 * LinkedIn and eBay and IBM
* Microsoft IoT
* 80% of the world's phone market runs Android
* Toyota, Audi, Ford, Mazda, Subaru, Mercedes..

### Q

What is free software?

+++
### Free software

The freedom to

* **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
* **study how the program works**, and change it
* **redistribute copies** so you can _help others_
* **distribute copies** of your modified versions


+++
### Q

What is open source?


+++
### Open source

1. Free Redistribution
2. Source Code
3. Derived Works
4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
7. Distribution of License
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral


+++
### Q

"Free software" vs "open source"?

* free: ideological
* open: practical



+++
### Q

But is it really free?

+++

is it free?

* Free as in "free speech"
* not necessarily free as in "free beer"


+++
### Q

Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?


+++

Money is "irrelevant"



+++
### Q

What is the legal basis of OSS licenses?


+++
### Opphavsrett Til Åndsverk

> den som skaper et åndsverk har opphavsrett
>
> unntak: datamaskinprogrammer.  opphavsrett går til arbeidsgiveren

_(«Lov om opphavsrett til åndsverk»)_




+++
### Copyright

* Free software is based on the copyright law
* Everything you create is your copyright _(opphavrett til åndsverk)_
* Licenses are contracts giving more rights



+++
### Free software

Two main classes of licenses:

* share-alike, _"copyleft"_
* anything you like, _"permissive"_


(requirements are only for distributing!)


+++
### Examples

* GNU GPL 2 (Linux, MediaWiki, Wordpress, +++)
* GNU GPL 3 (GCC, GNU, +++)
* GNU AGPL (Launchpad)
* GNU LGPL (QT, Vorbis, Segyio)
* MIT (Jenkins, Atom, Compiz, Mono, Node.js)
* APACHE (Android, Apache, Kubernetes, PyCharm)
* BSD (Chromium, D3, Django, Flask, Nginx, Vorbis)
* Creative Commons (Wikipedia content)
* Open Database Licence (OpenStreetMaps, ...)



+++
### GNU General Public License


+++
#### GPL 2/3 states

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under GPL 2/3
* (it must be possible to actually run it)

(GPL 3 contains some extra snack)


+++
#### AGPL 3 (Affero GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under AGPL
* if the software is served as "web publication"
 * the source must be distributed




+++
#### LGPL 3 (Library/Lesser GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under LGPL
* software using LGPL do not need be



+++
#### BSD, MIT & Apache

* BSD, MIT & Apache
 * Do as you wish
 * Retain license
* Apache
 * Some patent stuff


+++
### Creative commons

(for content)

* by = attribution
* sa = share-alike
* nc = non-commercial (non-free)
* nd = no-derivates (non-free)


+++
### Open Database Licence

Like cc-by-sa, but for "data"

+++
### Q

Which Open Source license should I choose to release my software under?



+++
### Q

Which Open Source license is best?



+++
### Q
Do I need to be afraid of open source?


+++
afraid of open source?

1. Are you only _using_ software?  No
2. Are you distributing/selling software?  Perhaps

+++
### Q

Do I need to give away my software if I use open source?


---
### Why, Equinor!?


* Three categories
 * company / shareholders
 * project / product
 * team / developers



+++
##### (company) commoditize complementaries

* demand of a product
* inverse of price for complementary products


+++
##### (company) Advertising and recruitment

* can show _«real development»_
* talks at conferences, workshops, universities
 * share knowledge
 * competence lift,
 * give something back


+++
##### (company) Openness yields trust

* increased confidence to the IT community
* One of Equinor's code values (**åpenhet**)
 * best way IT can be open
* open infrastructure (Kerckhoffs' principle)


+++
##### (project) Reduce product development time

* If you are based on proprietary software
 * ignore lots of knowledge and solved problems

> standing on the shoulders of giants



+++
##### (project) increased quality

* if you claim to be free
 * README
 * up-to-date description of product
 * instruction manual
 * installation manual
 * automatic tests

+++
##### (project) given enough eyeballs

* in open code (empirical and anecdotal)
 * fewer bugs
 * more tests
* we regularly receive feedback from externals
 * bugs
 * improvements
 * new functionality


+++
##### (team) complete focus on development

* open source software development has
 * GitHub
 * Travis
 * CircleCI
 * AppVeyor
 * Codacy
 * ...
* and easier access to the code(!)


+++
##### (developer) every patch and review is a ☆

* every
 * patch,
 * commit,
 * review a star in their resume
* we rarely get to show our work


+++
##### (developer) Contribute back

Create a
* pip package
* Debian package
* RedHat package
* npm package

Ubuntu? — you have completed the game!

> `apt install my_pkg`

+++
### Q
Does ~~the DoD~~ Equinor already use open source software?



+++
### Q
Is there any quantitative evidence that open source software is better than proprietary software?




+++
### Q
What are the risks of the government not releasing software as OSS?

+++

* Greatly increased costs (maintaining and developing)
* Inability to use improvements (patches and innovations)
* The development and release of a competing OSS project
* Questions about why the government is not releasing software paid for by the people


---

Happy coding
