### Free software

> Hvorfor gi noe bort gratis som vi har brukt millioner på å utvikle?!

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_


---
### History (before 1984)

* Software was written and distributed
* Different architectures
* Code was considered _«public domain»_
* 1975—85: Code is copyrightable; proprietary code

+++
### History (1980s)

* Richard Stallman started GNU Project
* —— wrote GNU Manifesto, later
 * Free Software Foundation
 * GNU General Public License (GPL)


+++
### History (1990s)

> I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and
> professional like gnu)

* Linux (1991)
* Linux lisensiert under GPL (1992)

+++
### History (1990s)

> OSS poses a direct, short-term revenue and platform threat to
> Microsoft, particularly in server space. Additionally, the intrinsic
> parallelism and free idea exchange in OSS has benefits that are not
> replicable with our current licensing model and therefore present a
> long term developer mindshare threat.

— Microsoft, Halloween documents (1998)

+++
### History (1990s)

Microsoft released two attacks on the OSS process

* _"fear, uncertainty and doubt"_ (FUD)
* _"embrace, extend, extinguish"_ (EEE)


+++
### Today

* 500 out of 500 supercomputers
* The majority of Microsoft Azure,
 * Google and Amazon
 * Facebook and Twitter and Instagram
 * LinkedIn and eBay and IBM
* Microsoft IoT
* 80% of the world's phone market runs Android
* Toyota, Audi, Ford, Mazda, Subaru, Mercedes..


---
### Licenses

+++
### Free software

The freedom to

* **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
* **study how the program works**, and change it
* **redistribute copies** so you can help others
* **distribute copies** of your modified versions


+++
### Open source

1. Free Redistribution
2. Source Code
3. Derived Works
4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
7. Distribution of License
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral


+++
### Opphavsrett Til Åndsverk

> den som skaper et åndsverk har opphavsrett
>
> unntak: datamaskinprogrammer.  opphavsrett går til arbeidsgiveren

_(«Lov om opphavsrett til åndsverk»)_




+++
### Copyright

* Free software is based on the copyright law
* Everything you create is your copyright _(opphavrett til åndsverk)_
* Licenses are contracts giving more rights



+++
### Free software

Two main classes of licenses:

* share-alike, _"copyleft"_
* anything you like, _"permissive"_



+++
### Examples

* GNU GPL 2 (Linux, MediaWiki, Wordpress, +++)
* GNU GPL 3 (GCC, GNU, +++)
* GNU AGPL (Launchpad)
* GNU LGPL (QT, Vorbis, Segyio)
* MIT (Jenkins, Atom, Compiz, Mono, Node.js)
* APACHE (Android, Apache, Kubernetes, PyCharm)
* BSD (Chromium, D3, Django, Flask, Nginx, Vorbis)
* Creative Commons (Wikipedia content)
* Open Database Licence (OpenStreetMaps, ...)

+++
### Examples

(important note)

requirements are only for distributing!

+++
### GNU General Public License


+++
#### GPL 2/3 states

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under GPL 2/3
* (it must be possible to actually run it)

(GPL 3 contains some extra snack)


+++
#### AGPL 3 (Affero GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under AGPL
* if the software is served as "web publication"
 * the source must be distributed




+++
#### LGPL 3 (Library/Lesser GPL)

* copy, modify, (re)distribute
* changes must be under LGPL
* software using LGPL do not need be


+++
#### BSD, MIT & Apache

* BSD, MIT & Apache
 * Do as you wish
 * Retain license
* Apache
 * Some patent stuff


+++
### Creative commons

(for content)

* by = attribution
* sa = share-alike
* nc = non-commercial (non-free)
* nd = no-derivates (non-free)


+++
### Open Database Licence

Like cc-by-sa, but for "data"


---
### Why, Equinor!?


* Three categories
 * company / shareholders
 * project / product
 * team / developers



+++
##### (company) commoditize complementaries

* demand of a product
* inverse of price for complementary products


+++
##### (company) Advertising and recruitment

* can show _«real development»_
* talks at conferences, workshops, universities
 * share knowledge
 * competence lift,
 * give something back


+++
##### (company) Openness yields trust

* increased confidence to the IT community
* One of Equinor's code values (**åpenhet**)
 * best way IT can be open
* open infrastructure (Kerckhoffs' principle)


+++
##### (project) Reduce product development time

* If you are based on proprietary software
 * ignore lots of knowledge and solved problems

> standing on the shoulders of giants



+++
##### (project) increased quality

* if you claim to be free
 * README
 * up-to-date description of product
 * instruction manual
 * installation manual
 * automatic tests

+++
##### (project) given enough eyeballs

* in open code (empirical and anecdotal)
 * fewer bugs
 * more tests
* we regularly receive feedback from externals
 * bugs
 * improvements
 * new functionality


+++
##### (team) complete focus on development

* open source software development has
 * GitHub
 * Travis
 * CircleCI
 * AppVeyor
 * Codacy
 * ...
* and easier access to the code(!)


+++
##### (developer) every patch and review is a ☆

* every
 * patch,
 * commit,
 * review a star in their resume
* we rarely get to show our work


+++
##### (developer) Contribute back

Create a
* pip package
* Debian package
* RedHat package
* npm package

Ubuntu? — you have completed the game!

> `apt install my_pkg`

# FAQ


+++
> What is "Open Source" software?

Software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared by anyone.


+++
> Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?

Yes!


+++
> But is it really free?

* Free as in "free speech"
* not necessarily free as in "free beer"


+++
> "Free software" vs "open source"?

* free: ideological
* open: practical



+++
> So if free=open, what is FOSS?

Free Open Source Software, if you don't want to pick a side.

+++
> ... and what is FLOSS?

Occasionally called Free/Libre Open Source Software.


+++
> What is "copyleft"?

"Copyleft" refers to licenses that are _share-alike_


+++
> What is a "permissive" Open Source license?

A "permissive" license is a non-copyleft open source license


+++
> Do I need to be afraid of open source?

1. Are you only _using_ software?  No
2. Are you distributing/selling software?  Perhaps

+++
> Do I need to give away my software if I use open source?

Not unless you distribute software containing copyleft software



+++
> Can I restrict how people use an Open Source licensed program?


No.


+++
> Can I stop "evil people" from using my program?

No.



+++
> What if I do not want to distribute my program in source form

Not "Open Source".


+++
> Which Open Source license should I choose to release my software under?

Good question!


+++
> Which Open Source license is best?

All of them



+++
> What are "contributor agreements"? Are they like open source licenses?

A legal document for contributors

* Contributor License Agreement (CLA)
* Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA)



+++
> Can I write proprietary code that links to a shared library that's open source?

Sometimes you can; it depends on the Open Source license.


+++
> How do I make money if anybody can sell my code?

* sell services based on the code
* sell warranties and other assurances
* sell customization and maintenance work
* license the trademark, etc.


+++
> Can I sell Open Source programs? Even if I haven't written it?

Yes.


+++
> Does Open Source mean anybody else can use my name and logo?

No.


+++
> How is OSS typically developed?

* OSS is typically developed through a collaborative process.
 * Users take part in testing and reporting, documenting etc.
 * This can create an avalanche-like “virtuous cycle”.

+++
> Isn't OSS developed primarily by inexperienced students?

* No.
* A study found average age ~ 30 years old, 12 years CS experience


+++
> What is the legal basis of OSS licenses?

Software licenses, including those for open source software, are typically based on copyright law.


+++
> Are OSS licenses legally enforceable?

Yes, in general.  Ask legal.


+++
> Can OSS licenses and approaches be used for material other than software?

Yes and no.  Creative commons and Open database license.


+++
> Is it more difficult to comply with OSS licenses than proprietary licenses?

No, complying with OSS licenses is much easier than proprietary licenses.


+++
> Doesn't hiding source code automatically make software more secure?

No.


+++
> Is there a risk of malicious code becoming embedded into OSS?

Any commercially-available software creates risk of executing malicious code


+++
> Does the DoD already use open source software?

Yes, extensively.


+++
> Is there any quantitative evidence that open source software can be as good as (or better than) proprietary software?

Yes


+++
> What are the risks of the government not releasing software as OSS?

* Greatly increased costs, (maintaining and developing)
* Inability to use improvements (patches and innovations)
* The development and release of a competing OSS project
* Questions about why the government is not releasing software paid for by the people
