# Talking about software development (bærekraftig utvikling)

We are software developers, but talk surprisingly little about software
development.

I want us to be more concerned with and actively talk about software
development.



# The Art of Unix Programming


> Those who do not understand Unix are condemned to reivent it, poorly.

-- Henry Spencer


> This is the Unix philosophy: Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
> Write programs to work together.  Write programs to handle text streams,
> because that is a universal interface.

-- Eric S. Raymond

1. Rule of Modularity: Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
2. Rule of Clarity: Clarity is better than cleverness.
3. Rule of Composition: Design programs to be connected to other programs.
4. Rule of Separation: Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
5. Rule of Simplicity: Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
6. Rule of Parsimony: Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
7. Rule of Transparency: Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
8. Rule of Robustness: Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
9. Rule of Representation: Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
10. Rule of Least Surprise: In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
11. Rule of Silence: When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
12. Rule of Repair: When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
13. Rule of Economy: Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
14. Rule of Generation: Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
15. Rule of Optimization: Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
16. Rule of Diversity: Distrust all claims for “one true way”.
17. Rule of Extensibility: Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.


Lets talk about API vs Code.

# Version numbers

Version numbering: 25.3, 8.0.0960, 4.13.7, 4.13.b1, 4.0.2, 2.60.3, 3.0, 1.13.3, 1.13.0rc2, 0.20.3, 1.8.3.1

Version numbering: 2017.10, 2017.10


## Software Release Cycle

> These are the facts of the case and they are undisputed.


### The anatomy of the version numer

Version numbering:  Major.Minor.Micro/Patch

* The major number should be increased whenever the API changes in an incompatible way.
* The minor number should be increased whenever the API changes in a compatible way.
* The micro number should be increased whenever the implementation changes, while the API does not.

Pre-alpha -> alpha -> beta -> release candidate -> gold

* If Micro contains a letter, a=alpha, b=beta, rc=release candidate
  * beta is intended stable, but may change
  * rc is feature frozen


## Why the obsession with version numbers?

Because better men than we paved the road.  They wrote unix, GNU coreutils,
Linux, all the software that we use and adore.  They found a way.

> The first and most important quality of modular code is encapsulation.
> Well-encapsulated modules don't expose their internals to each other.  They
> don't call into the middle of each others' implementations, and they don't
> promiscuously share global data.  They communicate using application
> programming interfaces (APIs) — narrow, well-defined sets of procedure calls
> and data structures.

-- Eric S. Raymond


A version is defined by its API, its functionality

Once a function goes in, it must stay in until next major version!


## Consequence of software development

Mantra: Bad code can be deleted, bad API is legacy

API = functionality
code = machinery

Code is something that coincidentally makes the API work.




# Popular scientific approach

## Site 1

* test first
* rigorous, regular refactoring
* continuous integration
* simple design
* single coding standard to which all programmers adhere

3 / 5

## Site 2

* PEP-8
* YAGNI (You ain't gonna need it)
* Test _your_ code, not others'
* API: Simple things should be simple, complex things should be possible
* Code is the enemy --- write less, delete, don't write
* External facing APIs are where design up-front matters!
  * Changing API is painful
  * creating backwards incompatibility is horrible
  * design carefully! (But keep simple things simple ...)
* If a function or method is more than 30LOC, break it up!
* Refactor --- keep in mind that programming is about abstractions (and we discover new abstractions as we go along)
* Always see your test fail once!  (Here's a question: Can we have a robot making random changes in code and see if tests fail?)
* Continuously address technical debt.

0/10.




# Code is mass

Code is mass and has a weight.  And somebody is going to carry it.

If we have the choice between implementing a feature, and using an existing
library, the pros and cons are:

* implement it yourself, you (or rather your team) carries the weight
* use somebody else's implementation, they carry the weight, you only carry the load of using that library (which may or may not be expensive)

If all else is equal, less code is better than more code.  Fewer lines is lower
weight.

We should think in terms of code as being something that's just there for the
API to work.

## How to design a good API

> There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so
> simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make
> it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is
> far more difficult.

-- C.A.R. Hoare


Use TDD: Sit down, and act like a user of your API!!

Command-query separation


Design by Contract
* Formal API (contracts)
* data invariants (who has seen the following?)

```
private void datainvariant() {
    assert this.age >= 0;
    assert !this.name.isEmpty();
    assert this.parent != null;
}
```

It's not necessarily a good idea, but it's good to have an idea about it.

## Code smells

> A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper
> problem in the system

-- Martin Fowler / Ken Beck

* Long method
* Conditional Complexity
* Large Class
* Type Embedded in Name
* Dead Code
* Speculative Generality (YAGNI)
* Data Class
* Indecent Exposure (You should have a compelling reason for every item you make public.)
* Lazy Class
