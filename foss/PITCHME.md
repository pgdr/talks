## Why Free Software?

(cc-by-sa 4.0)

> Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."

-- Linus Torvalds

### Make it easy to build

When putting your software out you need to also make clear and neutral
instructions

---

### Internal network means hidden assumptions
+++
When you build, test and deploy your code on your internal network you have
access to thousands of sweet libraries.

+++

However!  These sweet libraries come with a hidden cost, because they are hidden
assumptions.

+++

It makes your software tightly (and invisibly so) coupled to your internal
infrastructure.

+++

This makes it harder to change your infrastructure, and harder to change your
software.



---

### Why would we give away our precious software for free?

+++

A common misconseption is that free software is free to use.  Especially
software that is designed to solve one company's or customer's need.

+++

Anyone who wants to use the software themselves need to make changes and
bugfixes.

+++

These means that they (most likely) want to contribute back with new features,
new generalizations, new improvements, etc.

### Great advertising

+++

When you develop free software you can give a "10 Reasons Why My Company
Develops Free Software" on Booster.

+++

When recruting developers, you get to point them to code and review practices on
github or lauchpad or wherever you have your code.

+++

If you develop software that students might use, they can download it and test
it even before they start working in your company.
