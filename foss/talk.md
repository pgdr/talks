# Why Free Software?

> Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."

-- Linus Torvalds



## Make it easy to build

When putting your software out you need to also make clear and neutral
instructions



## Internal network means hidden assumptions

When you build, test and deploy your code on your internal network you have
access to thousands of sweet libraries.

However!  These sweet libraries come with a hidden cost, because they are hidden
assumptions.

It makes your software tightly (and invisibly so) coupled to your internal
infrastructure.

This makes it harder to change your infrastructure, and harder to change your
software.



## Why would we give away our precious software for free?

A common misconseption is that free software is free to use.  Especially
software that is designed to solve one company's or customer's need.

Anyone who wants to use the software themselves need to make changes and
bugfixes.

These means that they (most likely) want to contribute back with new features,
new generalizations, new improvements, etc.


## Great advertising

When you develop free software you can give a "10 Reasons Why My Company
Develops Free Software" on Booster.

When recruting developers, you get to point them to code and review practices on
github or lauchpad or wherever you have your code.

If you develop software that students might use, they can download it and test
it even before they start working in your company.
