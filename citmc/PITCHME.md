### Inhouse Software Development

+++

#### Why in-house development

* domain knowledge
* close with users
* keep knowledge ...
* speed of development
* Main benefit from softw. dev. is the knowledge

+++

#### Software engineering is unlike everything

* we never solve the same thing twice
* completely different project management
  * leaders do not understand the complexity
  * leaders do not believe developers' estimates
  * software projects are more like research projects than trad projects

+++

#### Software engineering is a craft

* craft
* profession
* complex field

However, we feel a lack of support

+++

#### Some drawbacks in large corporations

* > acquire trust by giving trust
* governing (controlling the creatively unpredictable)
  * > I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part
* bad management
  * The first law of bad management: If something isn't working, do more of it
* bad project lead believing they can
  * > People under time pressure don't think faster.
* bad strategies coming from above
  * ... a reverse correlation between technical competence and position in ladder
* non-developers doing development without understanding

---

#### Open development

* Open source
  * what is it
  * why we do it
* Open data
  * not so easy as people would like
  * increase understanding of facts
  * necessary for open standards
  * we are in a better position if
    * students
    * vendors
    * contractors know and understand the data and facts

### Free software (open source?)

>_All software developed by or for Equinor shall be made open source unless …_

### Summary

* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence
  * ratio of doers and non-doers is 20/80
