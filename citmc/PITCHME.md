#### Software engineering is unlike everything

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

software development is the art of formalizing ideas

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

we never solve the same thing twice

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

completely different project management

@ul
* leaders do not understand the complexity
* leaders do not believe developers' estimates
* software projects are more like research projects than trad projects
@ulend


---
#### Software engineering is a craft

@ul
* craft
* profession
* complex field
@ulend

+++
#### Software engineering is a craft

However, we feel a lack of support


---
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
* very close to users
* speed of development (weeks vs years)
* domain knowledge
* keep knowledge ...
* main benefit: knowledge
@ulend


+++
#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations


+++
#### challenge: governance

> acquire trust by giving trust

@css[fragment](**governing** = _controlling the creative & unpredictable_)

+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: management

> The first law of bad management
>
> If something isn't working, **do more of it**

+++
#### challenge: project lead

project leaders — _What you see is all there is_

@box[fragment](
> People under time pressure don't think faster.
)

+++
#### challenge: strategies

... an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul

* understanding of software
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices

@ulend

(note the omission of _governance_)

#### Open development

### Open source


+++
### Open source: what is it?
The freedom to

@ul
1. **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
1. **study how the program works**, and change it
1. **redistribute copies** so you can _help others_
1. **distribute copies** of your modified versions
@ulend
+++
### Open source: why do we do it?

@ul
* _(company)_ risks inherent in closed dev
* _(company)_ Advertising and recruitment
* _(company)_ Openness yields trust
* _(project)_ Reduce product development time
* _(project)_ increased quality
* _(project)_ given enough eyeballs
* _(team)_ complete focus on development
* _(developer)_ every patch and review is a ☆
* _(developer)_ Contribute back
@ulend

+++
### Open data

+++
### Open data: important contributor

@ul
* innovation
* business development
* openness in society
* increase understanding of facts
@ulend

+++
### Open data: open standards

@ul
* necessary for open standards
* we are in a better position if
  * students
  * vendors
  * contractors know and understand the data and facts
@ulend

+++
### Open data: the legal side of it

* not so easy as people would like

#### Programmer's oath

+++
##### Programmer's oath (1)
>I will not produce harmful code.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (2)
>The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (3)
>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (4)
>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (5)
>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (6)
>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (7)
>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (8)
>I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (9)
>I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence
  * ratio of doers and non-doers is 20/80
