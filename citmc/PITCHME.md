### Inhouse Software Development

---
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

software development is the art of formalizing ideas

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

we never solve the same thing twice

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

completely different project management

* leaders do not understand the complexity
* leaders do not believe developers' estimates
* software projects are more like research projects than trad projects








---
#### Software engineering is a craft

* craft
* profession
* complex field

However, we feel a lack of support










---
#### Why in-house development

* domain knowledge
* close with users
* keep knowledge ...
* speed of development
* Main benefit from softw. dev. is the knowledge

#### Some challenges in large corporations


+++
#### challenge: governance

> acquire trust by giving trust

governing (controlling the creatively unpredictable)

+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: management

bad management:
> The first law of bad management: If something isn't working, do more of it

+++
#### challenge: project lead

bad project lead believing they can

> People under time pressure don't think faster.

+++
#### challenge: strategies

* bad strategies coming from above
  * ... a reverse correlation between technical competence and position in ladder


+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development
* without even a basic understanding of software
* not even a rudimentary knowledge of development process
* unaware of even _good_ practices





---
#### Open development

+++
### Open source


+++
### Open source: what is it?
The freedom to

1. **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
1. **study how the program works**, and change it
1. **redistribute copies** so you can _help others_
1. **distribute copies** of your modified versions

+++
### Open source: why do we do it?

* _(company)_ risks inherent in closed dev
* _(company)_ Advertising and recruitment
* _(company)_ Openness yields trust
* _(project)_ Reduce product development time
* _(project)_ increased quality
* _(project)_ given enough eyeballs
* _(team)_ complete focus on development
* _(developer)_ every patch and review is a ☆
* _(developer)_ Contribute back

+++
### Open data

+++
### Open data: important contributor

* innovation
* business development
* openness in society
* increase understanding of facts

+++
### Open data: open standards

* necessary for open standards
* we are in a better position if
  * students
  * vendors
  * contractors know and understand the data and facts

+++
### Open data: the legal side of it

* not so easy as people would like

#### Programmer's oath

+++
##### Programmer's oath (1)
>I will not produce harmful code.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (2)
>The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (3)
>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (4)
>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (5)
>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (6)
>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (7)
>I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (8)

### Summary

* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence
  * ratio of doers and non-doers is 20/80
