### Inhouse Software Development

+++

Agenda

* Why in-house development
  * domain knowledge
  * close with users
  * keep knowledge ...
  * speed of development
  * Main benefit from softw. dev. is the knowledge
* Software engineering is unlike everything
  * we never solve the same thing twice
  * completely different project management
    * leaders do not understand the complexity
    * leaders do not believe developers' estimates
    * software projects are more like research projects than trad projects
* Some drawbacks in large corporations
  * governing (controlling the creatively unpredictable)
  * bad management
  * bad project lead believing they can
  * bad strategies coming from above
    * ... a reverse correlation between technical competence and position in ladder
  * non-developers doing development without understanding
* Open development
  * Open source
    * what is it
    * why we do it
  * Open data
    * not so easy as people would like
    * increase understanding of facts
    * necessary for open standards
    * we are in a better position if
      * students
      * vendors
      * contractors know and understand the data and facts
* Programmer's oath

### Free software (open source?)

>_All software developed by or for Equinor shall be made open source unless …_




+++
### Free software

> Hvorfor gi noe bort gratis som vi har brukt millioner på å utvikle?!

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

+++
### Free software

1. What is open source software?
2. Why do we use it?
3. Why do we give away code for free?

---
### Q

What is free software?

+++
### Free software

The freedom to

* **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
* **study how the program works**, and change it
* **redistribute copies** so you can help others
* **distribute copies** of your modified versions

+++
### Q

"Free software" vs "open source"?

* free: ideological
* open: practical



+++
### Q

But is it really free?

+++

is it free?

* Free as in "free speech"
* not necessarily free as in "free beer"


+++
### Q

Can Open Source software be used for commercial purposes?


+++

Money is "irrelevant"



+++
### Free software

Two main classes of licenses:

* share-alike, _"copyleft"_
* anything you like, _"permissive"_

(requirements are only for distributing!)

+++
### Examples

* GNU GPL 2 (Linux, MediaWiki, Wordpress, +++)
* GNU GPL 3 (GCC, GNU, +++)
* GNU AGPL (Launchpad)
* GNU LGPL (QT, Vorbis, Segyio)
* MIT (Jenkins, Atom, Compiz, Mono, Node.js)
* APACHE (Android, Apache, Kubernetes, PyCharm)
* BSD (Chromium, D3, Django, Flask, Nginx, Vorbis)
* Creative Commons (Wikipedia content, Volve, ...)
* Open Database Licence (OpenStreetMaps, Norne, ...)


---
### Why, Equinor!?


* Three categories
 * company / shareholders
 * project / product
 * team / developers



+++
##### (company) commoditize complementaries

* demand of a product
* inverse of price for complementary products


+++
##### (company) risks inherent in closed dev

* Greatly increased costs
* Inability to use improvements
* The release of a competing OSS project
* Questions about the openness of Equinor


+++
##### (company) Advertising and recruitment

* can show _«real development»_
* talks at conferences, workshops, universities
 * share knowledge
 * competence lift,
 * give something back


+++
##### (company) Openness yields trust

* increased confidence to the IT community
* One of Equinor's core values (**åpenhet**)
 * best way IT can be open
* open infrastructure (Kerckhoffs' principle)


+++
##### (project) Reduce product development time

* If you are based on proprietary software
 * ignore lots of knowledge and solved problems

> standing on the shoulders of giants



+++
##### (project) increased quality

* if you claim to be free/open
 * README
 * up-to-date description of product
 * instruction manual
 * installation manual
 * automatic tests

+++
##### (project) given enough eyeballs

* in open code (empirical and anecdotal)
 * fewer bugs
 * more tests
* we regularly receive feedback from externals
 * bugs
 * improvements
 * new functionality


+++
##### (team) complete focus on development

* open source software development has
 * GitHub
 * Travis
 * CircleCI
 * AppVeyor
 * Codacy
 * ...
* and easier access to the code(!)


+++
##### (developer) every patch and review is a ☆

* every
 * patch,
 * commit,
 * review a star in their resume
* we rarely get to show our work


+++
##### (developer) Contribute back

Create a
* pip package
* Debian package
* RedHat package
* npm package

Ubuntu? — you have completed the game!

> `apt install my_pkg`
