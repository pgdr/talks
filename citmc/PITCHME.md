### Inhouse Software Development

_(cc-by-sa 4.0)_

#### Software engineering is unlike everything

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

software development is the art of formalizing ideas

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

we never solve the same thing twice

+++
#### Software engineering is unlike everything

completely different project management

@ul
* leaders do not understand the complexity
* leaders do not believe developers' estimates
* software projects are more like research projects than trad projects
@ulend


---
#### Software engineering is a craft

... but who's on our side?


---
#### Why inhouse development

@ul
* long-term commitment, deep involvement
* direct access to users and developers
* being our own client makes life simpler, fail fast
* no language or culture boundaries
* have (access to) domain knowledge
* speed of development (weeks vs years)
* no off-the-shelf alternatives
* we may build on _all_ open source software
* we build the necessary culture
* build expertise ...
* main benefit: knowledge
@ulend


+++
#### Why inhouse development

The main benefit of a software development process:

* not the software itself
* the knowledge of the people

#### Some challenges in large corporations


+++
#### challenge: governance

> I will dictate to you exactly how you must do every aspect of the work ... except the hard part


+++
#### challenge: governance

"okay, management don't trust me, I'll just follow the rules ..."

The hard part is
@ul
* innovation
* going out on a limb
* being vulnerable
* being humble
* trying your best to solve a hard problem
* ... and improving status quo
@ulend


+++
#### challenge: governance

> acquire trust by giving trust

@css[fragment](**governing** = _controlling the creative & unpredictable_)


+++
#### challenge: no-slack incompetent project lead

@ul
* Limited respect for knowledge workers and the craft.
* Incompetent project leaders.
* Top-heavy project organization.
* _People under time pressure don't think faster._ (Lister's law)
@ulend

+++
#### challenge: strategies

> There is an inverse correlation between technical competence and position in professional ladder

— Pål's law

+++
#### challenge: undevelopment

non-developers doing development: no

@ul
* understanding of software
* conception of _correctness_
* knowledge of development process
* awareness of _good_ practices
* grasp about _cost and lifecycle commitment_
* _(note the omission of **governance**)_
@ulend



+++
#### challenge: mindlessly cutting costs,

or: how to throw the baby out with the bathwater
simultaneously losing trust

@snap[fragment]
>Optimization using data and model update resulted in increased production potential
@snapend

@snap[fragment]
>the value of this optimization has been estimated to NOK2bn
@snapend


+++
#### challenge: excellence — in what?

people doing "digital" delivering subpar


---
#### Some remedies ...

* Open development
* Community building
* Courses

(note omission of _governance_)


+++
### Open source


+++
### Open source: what is it?
The freedom to

@ul
1. **run the program** as you wish, for any purpose
1. **study how the program works**, and change it
1. **redistribute copies** so you can _help others_
1. **distribute copies** of your modified versions
@ulend
+++
### Open source: why do we do it?

@ul
* _(company)_ risks inherent in closed dev
* _(company)_ Advertising and recruitment
* _(company)_ Openness yields trust
* _(project)_ Reduce product development time
* _(project)_ increased quality
* _(project)_ given enough eyeballs
* _(team)_ complete focus on development
* _(developer)_ every patch and review is a ☆
* _(developer)_ Contribute back
@ulend

+++
### Open data

+++
### Open data: important contributor

@ul
* innovation
* business development
* openness in society
* increase understanding of facts
@ulend

+++
### Open data: open standards

@ul
* necessary for open standards
* we are in a better position if
  * students
  * vendors
  * contractors know and understand the data and facts
@ulend

+++
### Open data: the legal side of it

* not so easy as people would like

#### Programmer's oath

+++
##### Programmer's oath (1)
>I will not produce harmful code.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (2)
>The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (3)
>I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (4)
>I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (5)
>I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (6)
>I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

+++
##### Programmer's oath (7)

### Summary

> People are not your most important asset.  The right people are.

— Jim Collins

+++
### Summary

@ul
* Inhouse development is far superior to outsourced
* The knowledge always trumps any software
* Impediments:
  * lack of trust
  * leadership without experience in the field
  * lack of competence (but follow governance)
  * ratio of doers and non-doers is 20/80
  * little backing of the craft
